PHAGE -- 2015 7DRL roguelike

Build instructions
------------------

Phage should build with the Rust language compiler version 1.0.0.

If you're on Windows, you will also need to have MinGW GCC installed
and in your command line path to be able to build the third-party
dependencies.

With rustc in your path, just go to the Phage directory and type

    cargo run

for a faster-compiling debug build or

    cargo run --release

for the release build.
